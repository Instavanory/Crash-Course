        <h1>Moonbase Alpha: Our mission</h1>
        
        <p>In creating a base on the moon, we will be <strong>unlocking a new world of exploration</strong> into space.</p> 
        <p>Not only does it open up new scientific and economic avenues, but it also will help <em>bring mankind together</em> in a singular effort.
        A moonbase opens up <strong>multiple important economic avenues</strong>:</p> 
        
        <ul>
            <li>space tourists</li>
            <li>mining industries</li>
            <li>refueling stations</li>
        </ul>

        
        
        <img src="img/astro.jpeg" alt="an astronaght standing on the moon">
        
        <p>More importantly, it will also open the door to <em>unlocking future space exploration</em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>assess the health impacts of living in space</li>
            <li>learn how to build and operate a base on another celestial body</li>
            <li>test site for new technologies and spacecraft</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Few people have ever touched the surface of the moon, and no one has ever established a base there. <strong> You can be one of the very first</strong>.</p>

        <p>A moon base will provide a <em>refueling</em> station, and a low-gravity launch pad, enabling us to <strong>explore our galaxy</strong> at a much lower cost.</p>
